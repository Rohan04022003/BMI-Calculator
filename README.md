# BMI-Calculator
 I crafted a BMI calculator utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML structures the interface, CSS styles it, and JavaScript computes BMI based on user input. The calculator prompts users for height and weight, instantly displaying their BMI, empowering health-conscious decisions through quick and accessible assessments.
